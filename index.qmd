## Here Are Some Things About Me

- I've **worked with data** in a bunch of different industries: [IIoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_internet_of_things), Lending & Insurance, Application User Tracking, Marketing, Hotel & Airline, and Parking.

- I **studied mathematics** in grad school. I worked in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology). Still love reading about topology being applied to data &mdash; one day I hope it becomes useful!

- I've done **freelance [copy editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_editing)** since undergrad. *I hope you don't find any grammar issues on this page.*
